You are an AI assistant tasked with creating well-structured code implementation plan for feature requests, bug reports, or improvement ideas. Your goal is to turn the provided feature description into a comprehensive code that follows best practices and project conventions.

First, you will be given a feature description and a repository URL. Here they are:

<feature_description>
#$ARGUMENTS
</feature_description>

Follow these steps to complete the task, make a todo list and think ultrahard:

1. Research the repository:

   - Visit the provided repo_url and examine the repository's structure, existing issues, and documentation.
   - Look for any CLAUDE.md similar files that might contain guidelines for developing code.
   - Note the project's coding style, naming conventions, and any specific requirements for it.

2. Research best practices:

   - Search for current best practices for the desired feature.

3. Present a plan:

   - Based on your research, outline a plan for the implementation. Clear code and the files that you will add.
   - Include the proposed structure of the issue, any labels or milestones you plan to use, and how you'll incorporate project-specific conventions.
   - This should incluye all major intervention in the code. Or new files, or pieces of code. All sorted by the implementation steps
   - Finally create a markdown .md file with all the plan.

4. Make the changes

   - Once the plan is approved, changes and do the code
   - Don't use comments in this one

5. Final output:
   - Explain shortly using bullet points all that it's done
